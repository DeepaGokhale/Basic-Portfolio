       <P>Six species of toucan are found in Costa Rica: Black-mandibled, Keel-billed, Emerald Toucanet with a dark blue throat, Yellow-eared Toucanet, Fiery-Billed Aracari which is endemic to Costa Rica and Western Panama and the Collared Aracari in the Caribbean lowlands and Northern Pacific.
        </P>
       <p>The keel­billed Toucan is another bird that is easy to recognize. This species is most well­known for its beak, which is long and colorful.</p>
       <p>This Toucan is even sometimes referred to as the rainbow­billed toucan because of the progressive colored pattern on its beak. While the beak is beautiful, it is also functional; the birds use it to pick berries.</p>
       <p>If you are traveling within the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Reserve, La Selva Protected Zone & Biological Station or Tortuguero National Park, you are likely to see keel­billed Toucans traveling in small flocks.</p>     
       <p>Sometimes, when I know I am in Toucan territory, I like to try to listen for them rather than look for them; this species likes to sing songs, like crickets! Whether you are excited to get a glimpse of that rainbow beak, or you’re excited to hear a Toucan sing for you, spotting this bird in the wild will surely be quite the experience.</p>
